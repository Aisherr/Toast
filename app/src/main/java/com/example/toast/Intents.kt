/*Intents

What is an intent - in Android an "intent" is a  fundamental
component that is used for communication between different components
of an android application, as well as between different Android applications.

-> Intents serve a message-passing mechanism, allowing you to request an action
or start a new activity, service , or broadcast receiver. They are a key part of the
Android system's messaging system and facilitate interaction and data exchange between
different parts of your app and even between different apps.

There are two main types of Intents in Android:

   1.Explicit Intent: This type of Intent is used when you have a specific target component
     in mind within your own app. You explicitly specify the target component's class when
     creating the Intent.


   2.Implicit Intent: Implicit intents do not specify a specific target component; instead,
     they declare an action to be performed, and the Android system revolves the appropriate
     component that can handle that action based on it's intent filters.
