* Implicit Intents
*
* An implicit Intent in Android is used when you want to trigger an action or request
* that can be handled by any compatible app on the device. Unlike explicit intents
* that specify a specific target component within your app, Implicit intents declare an
* action to be performed and may include data, and the Android system determines which appp
* or component can handle the request based on the action and data provided.
